I am depositing an ongoing photo display project that uses simple HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

With this interface, the user can simply click on any of the thumbnails in the 4x4 gallery of images.
Upon clicking, the selected image is enlarged to the size of the grid container, and upon clicking again,
the 4x4 gallery will display again.

Currently I am aiming to make the project mobile friendly and more compatible in general with Mozilla and IE.s
